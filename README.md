# Data Visualisation Project

#### Iarla Sparrow Burke - G00405899

This is an [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/) app which displays a chart showing the changes in rankings of the songs in the Spotify Top 200 throughout the year of 2024. Data is taken from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/federicocester97/spotify-global-chart-2024) dataset on Kaggle. The chart is hosted at [this link](https://visualisation6.observablehq.cloud/spotify-datavis/).

To run the project locally, you must first install all the necessary dependencies. In the repository directory, run:

```
npm install
```

Then, to start the local preview server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

Then visit <http://localhost:3000> to preview the app.
